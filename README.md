## ðŸ¤– Naive Bayes Classification

**Problem Statement**:  
Classify observations using Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm based on probability theory.

**Data**:  
- Source: Naive Bayes Dataset (`Naive-Bayes-Classification-Data`)

**Data Mining Operations**:  
- Applied Gaussian Naive Bayes classification.
- Built confusion matrix and computed accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance using cross-tabulations.

**Model Outputs**:  
- Prediction labels.
- Model evaluation metrics.

**Limitations**:  
- Assumes feature independence, which may not always hold.

**Were you able to effectively solve the problem?**  
Yes, the Naive Bayes classifier produced high accuracy, particularly for simpler feature sets.
